\title{Produces summaries and plots of features distributed across genomes}
\description{
If you have a set of genomic ranges, the GenomicDistributions R package can
help you with some simple visualizations. Currently, it can produce two kinds
of plots: First, the chromosome distribution plot, which visualizes how your
regions are distributed over chromosomes; and second, the feature
distribution plot, which visualizes how your regions are distributed relative
to a feature of interest, like Transcription Start Sites (TSSs).
